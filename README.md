# Alphabet Soup Funding Success Prediction

## Overview

Welcome to my Alphabet Soup Funding Success Prediction project! As a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, I was tasked with creating a model that predicts the success of startup funding applications. My goal was to develop a binary classification model using a deep neural network that determines whether applicants would become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Background

Alphabet Soup's business team dealt with numerous funding applications from startups daily. My mission was to leverage my expertise in machine learning and neural networks to analyze a CSV dataset containing information about over 34,000 organizations that received funding from Alphabet Soup. The dataset included various attributes, including indicators of whether these organizations achieved success after receiving funding.

## Objectives


In this project, I accomplished the following three technical deliverables:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: I prepared the dataset for training by performing necessary data preprocessing. This step was crucial for feeding meaningful inputs into the neural network.

2. **Model Development**: Utilizing the model-fit-predict pattern, I designed, compiled, and evaluated a deep neural network for binary classification. This network learned patterns from the dataset to predict whether an applicant would attain success.

3. **Model Optimization**: With the initial model in place, my task was to fine-tune its parameters and architecture to achieve the highest predictive accuracy possible.

## Conclusion

By successfully completing this project, I contributed to Alphabet Soup's ability to make informed funding decisions. My binary classification model assisted the business team in identifying promising startup applicants and enhanced the overall efficiency of the funding process. I am proud to have predicted Alphabet Soup's funding success!
